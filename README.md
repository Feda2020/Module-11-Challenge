## Description

This assignment consists of two technical products. Submitting the following deliverables:

- Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
- Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table. 

## Deliverable 1

In a Jupyter Notebook we did the following:

* Use automated browsing to visit the Mars news siteLinks to an external site. 
* Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.
* Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to extract text elements from the website.
* Extract the titles and preview text of the news articles that we scraped. 
* Store the scraping results in Python data structures
* Store all the dictionaries in a Python list.
* Print the list in your notebook.

## Deliverable 2

* Use automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data SiteLinks to an external site. Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape. 
### Note:
 The URL is (https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html)

* Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame. 
* Examine the data types that are currently associated with each column. 

## Data Analysis

This analysis focuses on the weather conditions recorded on Mars, specifically examining minimum temperatures and atmospheric pressure over time. The goal is to identify trends and correlations that may offer insights into Martian climate patterns.

The temperature fluctuates between approximately -90°C and -65°C, indicating significant variations as seasons progress. By observing the time intervals between repeated cycles, we can estimate the length of a Martian year, which appears to be around 687 Earth days.

The data shows a gradual increase in atmospheric pressure from month 6 to month 9, after which it decreases again. This could indicate seasonal atmospheric changes on Mars, with month 9 experiencing the highest pressure at over 900 Pa.
